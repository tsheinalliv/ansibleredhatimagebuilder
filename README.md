# Red Hat Image Builder Automation & Red Hat Image Builder Automation for Azure Deployment
----------------------------
This is a starter kit for automation of Red Hat image builder and deploying to azure with ansible. This repository is intended for users to get familiar with automating Red Hat image builder, and to get started pushing images to the cloud like Azure , G.C.P and etc. I welcome others to come and work on this project because at the time of this publishing (08/10/2021) there isn't any documentation on ansible and red hat image builder running together.
